## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **OCR Accuracy Issues**
   - **Risk**: Google Vision API may not accurately extract text from all document types
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pre-processing of images, test with diverse sample documents, and develop fallback mechanisms

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Risk**: Processing large documents may cause performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Implement asynchronous processing, optimize database queries, and set up proper caching

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - **Risk**: Sensitive document data may be exposed
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper authentication, encryption, and secure file handling

4. **Integration Challenges**
   - **Risk**: Integration between frontend and backend may face challenges
   - **Mitigation**: Define clear API contracts, implement comprehensive error handling, and conduct regular integration testing

5. **Compliance Issues**
   - **Risk**: System may not meet all regulatory requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct compliance review early, implement necessary controls, and document compliance measures

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. The system can accurately extract information from at least 90% of the supported document types
2. The validation logic correctly identifies authentic and complete documents with at least 85% accuracy
3. The system can process documents within an average of 30 seconds
4. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for document upload and result visualization
5. The system meets all security and compliance requirements
6. The APIs are properly documented and can be used by other microservices
