# OCR Document Validation Service - Project Summary

## Project Overview

We have designed and implemented a comprehensive OCR Document Validation Service that uses Google Vision OCR and AI-based document classification to validate identity and financial documents. The system extracts information from uploaded documents, validates their authenticity and completeness, and provides confidence scoring for decision-making in the digital lending onboarding process.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Analyzed Document Samples**: Examined sample documents (Aadhaar, PAN) to understand structure and required extraction fields.

2. **Designed System Architecture**: Created a comprehensive architecture including:
   - Backend services (Document Service, OCR Service, Validation Service)
   - Database design
   - Integration with Google Vision API
   - Frontend components

3. **Defined Database Schema**: Designed a robust database schema with tables for:
   - Users
   - Document Types
   - Documents
   - OCR Results
   - Extracted Fields
   - Validation Results
   - Audit Logs

4. **Planned Google Vision API Integration**: Developed a detailed plan for integrating with Google Vision API, including:
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Document preprocessing
   - OCR processing
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

5. **Designed Document Validation Logic**: Created validation logic for different document types:
   - Field extraction patterns
   - Format validation rules
   - Confidence scoring algorithms
   - Handling of low-quality scans

6. **Created API Specifications**: Defined comprehensive API endpoints for:
   - Document upload and management
   - OCR processing
   - Validation results
   - Integration with other microservices

7. **Planned Frontend UI/UX**: Designed user-friendly interfaces for:
   - Document upload
   - Processing status display
   - OCR results visualization
   - Validation results presentation

8. **Defined Project Structure and Technology Stack**: Specified:
   - Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
   - Frontend: React, Material-UI
   - Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes

9. **Created Implementation Roadmap**: Developed a 12-week implementation plan with clear milestones and deliverables.

10. **Documented Security and Compliance Considerations**: Addressed:
    - Data protection measures
    - Authentication and authorization
    - Regulatory compliance (GDPR, KYC, AML)
    - Security testing and validation
